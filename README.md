# 📈 **Smart Lender - Applicant Credibility Prediction** 🚀

This project leverages **Machine Learning** to predict an applicant's loan approval probability based on their financial credibility. Using models like **Decision Trees, Random Forest, KNN, and XGBoost**, it helps financial institutions assess risk and reduce potential loan defaults. The best-performing model is integrated into a **Flask-based web application** for easy user interaction and deployed on **IBM Cloud**.
